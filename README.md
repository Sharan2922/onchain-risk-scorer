# AI-Powered On-Chain Risk Scorer

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The AI-Powered On-Chain Risk Scorer is a blockchain analytics tool that evaluates the risk level of cryptocurrency tokens by analyzing live on-chain data (e.g., ERC-20 transfers, whale movements, liquidity changes) and applying AI models to assign a **risk score** (similar to a credit score but for crypto assets).

This project combines **Blockchain Data Engineering**, **AI/ML**, and **Financial Risk Analysis** to help traders, investors, and analysts make informed decisions.
